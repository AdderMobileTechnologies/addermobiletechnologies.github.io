                <blockquote><strong>ATLANTA, November 15, 2019 — On Friday, nine startups from around the world pitched their companies and innovative ideas to an audience of nearly 1,000 investors, strategic partners, mentors, and industry leaders in Atlanta during Demo Day, the conclusion of the third class of the Comcast NBCUniversal’s The Farm, powered by <a href="https://boomtownaccelerators.com" target="_blank"><em><b>Boomtown.</b></em></a>&nbsp;</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The Farm is an accelerator based in Comcast’s Regional headquarters in the Battery Atlanta, and provides early-stage startups with the resources, access, expertise, and advice they need to succeed. For 12 weeks, 24 founders called Atlanta their home, and worked with mentors and entrepreneurs from Comcast NBCUniversal and Boomtown to strengthen and advance their companies. The program focused on financial fundamentals, customer acquisition, storytelling, fundraising, sales, marketing, and more. This is the third cohort to graduate from The Farm with startups developing innovative solutions in industries ranging from eSports to fintech to smart advertising.  The founders of the third Farm class are entrepreneurs from all over the world, including Argentina, Bolivia, England, India, and Nigeria. US-based founders hail from Atlanta, Colorado, Tennessee, Miami, and Kentucky.&nbsp;</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
</strong><strong>Four of the companies in the cohort announced paid pilots. Adder, a platform that connects smartphone data to outdoor advertisers, announced a pilot with a major outdoor advertiser. CyberClipboard, a staffing marketplace, has several pilots in place including an LOI for a pilot with a prominent college in Atlanta. ParkENT, a provider of a network of eBike stations, announced paid pilots with MobileAppHero for a station in Buckhead, GA, and another with the City of Roswell, GA. Fingoal, a personal finance app, has paid pilots with banks in Colorado, Iowa, and Georgia.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
</strong><strong>“It’s been incredible to watch the evolution of these founders as they’ve collaborated and worked with leaders across Comcast NBCUniversal,” said Bill Connors, president of Comcast’s Central Division. “We recognize the massive potential of these startups, and continue to be excited to work with early stage companies to help influence the trajectory of their businesses.”&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
</strong><strong>“At The Farm, we customize our curriculum for each class to empower founders to succeed by providing the essentials they need to build their business,” said Burunda Prince, managing director of The Farm. “Like our previous two cohorts, we look forward to supporting these companies as they grow their customer base, create strategic partnerships, and successfully scale.”&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
</strong><strong>The Farm’s third cohort includes:&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Adder is a platform that analyzes location data from consumer smartphones and other data streams to deliver actionable insights to outdoor advertisers. Correlating GPS data to branded locations helps outdoor advertisers and their customers understand when and where to place which ads, saving money on placements and increasing advertising ROI.

</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founders: Dominique Pennington, Clint Adams, Danny Freeman | Chattanooga, TN
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>CyberClipboard’s Business Tracking System (BTS) is a staffing marketplace platform that matches task-based workers with trusted businesses based on pre-verified worker skills, work histories, and backgrounds.

Businesses integrated with the BTS can use staff recruitment and social engagement tools to build worker communities, reducing their staffing and onboarding costs.

</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founders: David Nohe &amp; Jack Ryan | Lafayette, CO
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>OlimpoLabs’ flagship product, Apollo 01, is a wearable device that alerts athletes as they approach an “overtraining” threshold, giving them in-depth information into their muscular condition and any imbalances. Such information allows them to make real-time adjustments to their training regimen to avoid problems that could lead to injury. Apollo 01 will provide data-analytics that incorporate benchmarks and training suggestions to improve individual athletes’ training and help avoid preventable injuries.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Founders: David Moreira &amp; Augusto Chesini | Buenos Aires, Argentina
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>ParkENT Cycles provides destination points/stations for E-Bike riders. Stations provide a place to securely charge batteries.
